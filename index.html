    <h1>Minimize your belongings. There are many ways that having too much is hazardous to a healthy way of life. The more you own, the more time and mental energy you spend keeping track of it, and the more you worry about breaking or losing what you worked so hard to get. A cluttered environment causes stress, conscious or not, every time you come home and look at it. Keep only the things in your life that you use and actually matter to you. This can bring simplicity to your life, and clarity to your mind.</h1></section>

<h1>Cleaning and organizing is a practice, and not a project. If you are organized, you will have more balance in your life. You will be able to minimize the time spent on necessary things like shopping and looking for things, but increase the time spent on important things such as family, friends, and the things you enjoy. The art of organizing is to find ways to make daily life more efficient. </h1>
